ds1 80 200 2 4 2

The above would imply that the dataset is ds1, the percent of the dataset to be used for
training is 80%, the maximum number of iterations is 200, and there are 2 hidden layers with
(4, 2) neurons. Your program would have to initialize the weights randomly. Remember to take
care of the bias term (w0) also.
