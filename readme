**This is a ML Assignment 3**

There are 3 main Python files in this project.
	
	1. preprocessing.py - This file inputs the path of the unprocessed raw data, preprocesses the data and then outputs it. There are two command-line argument - input path and output path.
	
	2. neural_network.py - It contains all the data structures needed to build the decision tree. It has Node, Neural Network, Edges and the Bias. Everything is randomized and then errors are back propagated to train the model.
	
	3. neural_net_main.py -  

`*Open the id3_main.py file and make sure to keep the whole folder intact.*`
